# Parkify
A project built in UofTHacks to help streamline parking services.

The client will login using a web app throught Firebase to access the smartcar API. From there they can log in their car company's account and provide access to location and car info. This data will be pushed to Firebase and utilised by an Android app to determine if the car is in the parking space or not.
